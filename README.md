# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game-using-Python

## Let's break down the implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game step by step, starting with the installation of Python and the necessary libraries.


## **Step 1**: `Installing Python`
If you don't have Python installed on your computer, you can download it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.

## **Step 2**: `Creating a New Python File`
Open a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice and create a new file with a .py extension, such as rock_paper_scissors.py. This will be our Python script for the game.

## **Step 3**: `Importing the Necessary Libraries`
In this game, we'll need the random library to generate the computer's choice randomly. To import the random library, add the following line at the beginning of your Python script.
```py
import random
```

## **Step 4**: `Defining the Game Logic`
Next, let's define the game logic by creating a function that handles the gameplay. We'll call this function play_game. Here's an example of how you can define the play_game function.

## **Step 5**: `Handling Invalid User Input`
To handle cases where the user enters an invalid choice, we can add some validation to ensure they only enter "rock," "paper," or "scissors." Modify the play_game function.

## **Step 6**: `Keeping Score`
To keep track of the score, we can introduce variables to count the number of rounds won by the user, the computer, and the draws. Modify the play_game function.

## **Step 7**: `Starting the Game`
To start the game, we need to call the play_game function. Add the following line at the end of your script.
```py
play_game()
```

## **Step 8**: `Running the Game`
Save your Python script and open a command prompt or terminal. Navigate to the directory where you saved the script and run the following command.
```py
python rock_paper_scissors.py
```

`The game will start, and you can follow the instructions to play against the computer. The score will be displayed after each round, and you can enter "q" at any time to quit the game.`
